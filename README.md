New frontend for audit express 5.
working on a new title since i found out audit express is already a thing.

most of this project is me learning how to do html, jscript and css.
uses electron



Originally written in python to automate some of the things in opera pms.
Mainly made this for night audit, but the other shifts love the login feature.
some things it does (but not this once since its just the new interface testing)
- automatic login
- automate folio batching 
- automate printing reports

--Until stuff is compiled --
REQUIRED 
-pyautogui
-pillow
